# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and the objective is to get three X's or O's in a row.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing X's and O's on the board.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

## How to Play

1. Open main.html in your web browser.
2. Click on a cell to place your symbol (X or O).
3. The game will automatically switch turns between players.
4. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a message will be displayed and the game will be reset.
